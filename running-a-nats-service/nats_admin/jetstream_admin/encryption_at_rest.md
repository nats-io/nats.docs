# Encryption at Rest

*Supported since NATS server version 2.3.0*

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note, although this feature is supported, we recommend file system encryption if available.
{% endhint %}

The NATS server can be configured to encrypt message blocks which includes message headers and payloads. Other metadata files are encrypted as well, such as the stream metadata file and consumer metadata files.

Two choices of ciphers are currently supported:

- `chachapoly` - [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/chacha20poly1305)
- `aes` - [AES-GCM](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/aes)

Enabling encryption is done through the `jetstream` [configuration block](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/README.md#jetstream) on the server.

```text
jetstream : {
  cipher: chachapoly
  key : "6dYfBV0zzEkR3vxZCNjxmnVh/aIqgid1"
}
```

It is recommended to provide the encryption key through an environment variable at runtime, such as `$JS_KEY`, so it will not be persisted in a file.

```text
jetstream : {
  cipher: chachapoly
  key: $JS_KEY
}
```

The variable can be exported in the environment or passed when the server starts up.

```shell
JS_KEY="mykey" nats-server -c js.conf
```

## Changing encryption settings

### Enabling with existing data

Enabling encryption on a server with existing data is supported. Do note that existing unencrypted message blocks will not be re-encrypted, however any new blocks that are stored _will_ be encrypted going forward.

If it is desired to encrypt the existing blocks, the stream can be backed up and restored (which decrypts on backup and then re-encrypts when restoring it).


### Disabling or changing the key

If encryption was enabled on the server and the server is restarted with a different key or disabled all together, the server will fail to decrypt messages when attempting to load them from the store. If this happens, youâ€™ll see log messages like the following:

```text
Error decrypting our stream metafile: chacha20poly1305: message authentication failed
```

Note, that this will impact JetStream functionality, but the server will still support core NATS functionality.

### Changing the cipher

It is possible to change the `cipher`, however the same key must be used. The server will properly encrypt new message blocks with the new cipher and decrypt existing messages blocks with the existing cipher.

## Performance considerations

Performance considerations: As expected, encryption is likely to decrease performance, but by how much is hard to define. In some performance tests on a MacbookPro 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 with SSD, we have observed as little as 1% decrease to more than 30%. In addition to CPU cycles required for encryption, the encrypted files may be larger, which results in more data being stored or read.
