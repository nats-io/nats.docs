# Clustering Configuration

The [`cluster` configuration map](../../configuration/README.md#clustering) has the following configuration options:

| `host`                             | Interface where the gateway will listen for incoming route connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `listen`                           | Combines `host` and `port` as `<host>:<port>`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `tls`                              | A [`tls` configuration map](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/tls.md) for securing the clustering connection. `verify` is always enabled and `cert_file` is used for client and server. [See](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/tls.md#wrong-key-usage) for certificate pitfalls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `advertise` or `cluster_advertise` | Hostport `<host>:<port>` to advertise how this server can be contacted by other cluster members. This is useful in setups with NAT. When using TLS this is important to set to control the hostname that clients will use when discovering the route since by default this will be an IP, otherwise TLS hostname verification may fail with an IP SANs error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `no_advertise`                     | When set to 'true', the server will not gossip its server URLs to clients. This also disables `client_advertise` in the [general configuration](../README.md) section. Disabling advertise completely can be useful if the server can be reached via different load balancers and interfaces from different networks. Automatically advertising an internal IP address could result in reconnect delays due to failed attempts.

| `routes`                           | A list of other servers (URLs) to cluster with. Self-routes are ignored. Should authentication via `token` or `username`/`password` be required, specify them as part of the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `connect_retries`                  | After how many failed connect attempts to give up establishing a connection to a discovered route. Default is `0`, do not retry. When enabled, attempts will be made once a second. This, does not apply to explicitly configured routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `authorization`                    | [Authorization](../securing_nats/auth_intro#authorization-map) map for configuring cluster routes. When a single `username`/`password` is used, it defines the authentication mechanism this server expects, and how this server will authenticate itself when establishing a connection to a _discovered_ route. This will not be used for routes explicitly listed in `routes` and therefore have to be provided as part of the URL. With this authentication mode, either use the same credentials throughout the system or list every route explicitly on every server. If the `tls` configuration map specifies `verify_and_map` only provide the expected `username`. Here different certificates can be used, but they have to map to the same `username`. The authorization map also allows for `timeout` which is honored but `users` and `token` configuration are not supported and will prevent the server from starting. The `permissions` block is ignored. |
