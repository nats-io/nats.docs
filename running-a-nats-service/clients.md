# NATS server clients

A NATS client is an application making a connection to one of the nats servers pointed to by its connection URL, and uses a credential file to authenticate and indicate its authorization to the server and the whole NATS infrastructure.

The nats-server doesn't come bundled with any clients, but its companion is the [`nats`](../using-nats/nats-tools/nats\_cli/) CLI tool that you should install (even if you don't intend to run your own servers) as it is the best tool to use to test, monitor, manage and generally interact with a NATS infrastructure (regardless of that infrastructure being an isolated local server, a leaf node server, a cluster or even a global super-cluster).

Other NATS client tools to know about are the [`nsc`](../using-nats/nats-tools/nsc/) CLI tool (to manage accounts attributes and user JWT tokens) and the ['nk'](../using-nats/nats-tools/nk.md) tool (and library) to manage Nkeys.

Also, most client libraries come with sample programs that allow you to publish, subscribe, send requests and reply messages.


## Install the `nats` CLI Tool

From the shell (all platforms), to get the binary for the latest (top of the `main` branch) version of `nats` you can simply do:
```shell
curl -sf https://binaries.nats.dev/nats-io/natscli/nats | sh
```

You can also get a specific version by adding `@` followed by the version's tag, example: `curl -sf https://binaries.nats.dev/nats-io/natscli/nats@v0.1.4 | sh`

For macOS:

```shell
brew tap nats-io/nats-tools
brew install nats-io/nats-tools/nats
```

For Arch Linux:

```shell
yay natscli
```

Binaries are also available as [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases).

## Test your setup

Open a terminal and [start a nats-server](./installation.md):

```shell
nats-server
```

```

```

On another terminal session first check the connection to the server

```shell
nats server check connection 
```

```
OK Connection OK:connected to nats://127.0.0.1:4222 in 790.28µs OK:rtt time 69.896µs OK:round trip took 0.000102s | connect_time=0.0008s;0.5000;1.0000 rtt=0.0001s;0.5000;1.0000 request_time=0.0001s;0.5000;1.0000
```

Note by default the `nats` command line client attempts to connect to a NATS server running on `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. This means you can run most nats commands without explicitly specifying a server address.

Next, start a subscriber using the `nats` CLI tool:

```shell
nats subscribe ">" 
```

Note that when the client connected, the server didn't log anything interesting because server output is relatively quiet unless something interesting happens.

To make the server output more lively, you can specify the `-V` flag to enable logging of server protocol tracing messages. Go ahead and `<ctrl>+c` the process running the server, and restart the server with the `-V` flag:

```shell
nats-server -V
```

```

If you had created a subscriber, you should notice output on the subscriber telling you that it disconnected, and reconnected. The server output above is more interesting. You can see the subscriber send a `CONNECT` protocol message and a `PING` which was responded to by the server with a `PONG`.

> You can learn more about the [NATS protocol here](../reference-protocols.md), but more interesting than the protocol description is [an interactive demo](../reference/nats-protocol/nats-protocol-demo.md).

On a third terminal, publish your first message:

```shell
nats pub hello world 
```

On the subscriber window you should see:

```
[#1] Received on "hello"
world
```

## Test against a remote server

If the NATS server were running in a different machine or a different port, you'd have to specify that to the client by specifying a _NATS URL_ (either in a `nats context` or using the `-s` flag).

### NATS URLs

NATS URLs take the form of: `nats://<server>:<port>` and `tls://<server>:<port>`. URLs with a `tls` protocol sport a secured TLS connection.

If you are connecting to a cluster you can specify more than one URL (comma separated). Example: `nats://localhost:4222,nats://localhost:5222,nats://localhost:6222` if you are running a test cluster of 3 nats servers on your local machine, listening at ports 4222, 5222, and 6222 respectively.

### Example

```shell
nats sub -s nats://server:port ">"
```

If you want to try on a remote server, the NATS team maintains a demo server you can reach at `demo.nats.io`.

```shell
nats sub -s nats://demo.nats.io ">"
```
