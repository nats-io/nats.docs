# Run Synadia Cloud (NGS) leaf nodes in Docker

This mini-tutorial shows how to run 2 NATS server in local Docker containers interconnected via [Synadia Cloud Platform](https://cloud.synadia.com?utm_source=nats_docs&utm_medium=nats).
NGS is a global managed NATS network of NATS, and the local containers will connect to it as leaf nodes.

Start by creating a free account on [https://cloud.synadia.com/](https://cloud.synadia.com?utm_source=nats_docs&utm_medium=nats).

Once you are logged in, go into the `default` account (you can manage multiple isolated NGS account within your Synadia Cloud account).

In `Settings` > `Limits`, increase `Leaf Nodes` to 2. Save the configuration change.
(Your free account comes with up to 2 leaf connection, but the account is configured to use at most 1 initially).

Now navigate to the `Users` section of your `default` account and create 2 users, `red` and `blue`.
(Users are another way you can isolate parts of your systems customizing permissions, access to data, limits and more)

For each of the two users, select `Get Connected` and `Download Credentials`.

You should now have 2 files on your computer: `default-red.creds` and `default-blue.creds`.

Create a minimal NATS Server configuration file `leafnode.conf`, it will work for both leaf nodes:

```
leafnodes {
    remotes = [
        {
          url: "tls://connect.ngs.global"
          credentials: "ngs.creds"
        },
    ]
}
```

Let's start the first leafnode (for user `red`) with:

```shell
docker run  -p 4222:4222 -v leafnode.conf:/leafnode.conf -v /etc/ssl/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/cert.pem -v default-red.creds:/ngs.creds  nats:latest -c /leafnode.conf
```

`-p 4222:4222` maps the server port 4222 inside the container to your local port 4222.
`-v leafnode.conf:/leafnode.conf` mounts the configuration file created above at location `/leafnode.conf` in the container.
`-v /etc/ssl/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/cert.pem` installs root certificates in the container, since the `nats` image does not bundle them, and they are required to verify the TLS certificate presented by NGS.
`-v default-red.creds:/ngs.creds` installs the credentials for user `red` at location `/ngs.creds` inside the container.
`-c /leafnode.conf` are arguments passed to the container entry point (`nats-server`).

Launching the container, you should see the NATS server starting successfully:
```
[1] 2024/06/14 18:03:51.810719 [INF] Server is ready
[1] 2024/06/14 18:03:52.075951 [INF] 34.159.142.0:7422 - lid:5 - Leafnode connection created for account: $G
[1] 2024/06/14 18:03:52.331354 [INF] 34.159.142.0:7422 - lid:5 - JetStream using domains: local "", remote "ngs"
```

Now start the second leaf nodes with two minor tweaks to the command:
```
docker run  -p 4333:4222 -v leafnode.conf:/leafnode.conf -v /etc/ssl/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/cert.pem -v default-blue.creds:/ngs.creds  nats:latest -c /leafnode.conf
```

Notice we bind to local port `4333` (since `4222`) is busy, and we mount `blue` credentials.

Congratulations, you have 2 leaf nodes connected to the NGS global network.
Despite this being a global shared environment, your account is completely isolated from the rest of the traffic, and vice versa.

Now let's make 2 clients connected to the 2 leaf nodes talk to each other.

Let us start a simple service on the Leafnode of user `red`:
```shell
nats -s localhost:4222 reply docker-leaf-test "At {{Time}}, I received your request: {{Request}}"
```

Using the LeafNode run by user `blue`, let's send a request:
```shell
$ nats -s localhost:4333 request docker-leaf-test "Hello World"

At 8:15PM, I received your request: Hello World
```

Congratulations, you just connected 2 Leaf nodes to the global NGS network and used them to send a request and receive a response.

Your messages were routed transparently with millions of others, but they were not visible to anyone outside of your Synadia Cloud account.
