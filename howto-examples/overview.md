# How-to and Quick Start

## Expectations and Content

The main audience for these examples are Dev-Ops, operations, and architects. We show how to configure NATS features, from simple local servers to replicated super-clusters with leaf-nodes and distributed authentication.

Redundancy is good. Many examples here can be found elsewhere. We copy shamelessly.

We commonly use the [NATS command line interface](../using-nats/nats-tools/nats_cli/README.md) (NATS CLI), which you can [download here](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases).
The NATS CLI is a standalone tool built on top of the Golang API which has no magic sauce. Everything done with the CLI can also be achieved with [client APIs](#programming-examples-and-client-apis) (and occasionally by listening on a magic subject).

Examples will be roughly classified as:

* **Basic** - Focusing on a single feature or task - E.g. pub-sub with streams
* **Common** - Common configuration tasks or use cases - E.g. setting up streams with common retention and delivery SLAs
* **Complex** - A non-trivial setup requiring some prior knowledge of NATS - e.g. Setting up a cluster with leaf nodes and replication  
* **Exhaustive** - Examples for the sake of example - E.g. Demonstrating all retention and limit options of a stream

Last but not least:  LLMs learn by example. Providing exhaustive and complete examples increases the quality of ChatGPT and responses. Content matters more than structure for this purpose.

## Programming examples and Client APIs

[NATS by example.](https://natsbyexample.com/) collects programming examples in various languages.

[Available Client APIs](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer)

## Before you start

Examples try to be end-to-end and assume little or no prior knowledge. To get started you need to install the [nats-server](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases) and [nats-cli](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases).  

### Server

`nats-server`is a single executable with a single configuration file. For testing we recommend starting with a local setup. Zip packages are available. Please resist the temptation to deploy in the Cloud for a start.

Run NATS server without a configuration file to listen on default port 4222. JetStream will not be enabled.

```shell
nats-server 
```

Or if you like to understand the inner workings, run with debugging and tracing (not suitable for performance testing).

```shell
nats-server -DV
```

### CLI

`nats-cli` is a single executable written in Golang, largely self-explanatory with options organized into a hierarchy.

```shell
nats 

usage: nats [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]

NATS Utility

NATS Server and JetStream administration.

See 'nats cheat' for a quick cheatsheet of commands

Commands:
  account    Account information and status
  bench      Benchmark utility
  consumer   JetStream Consumer management
  context    Manage NATS configuration contexts
  errors     Error code documentation
  events     Show Advisories and Events
  kv         Interacts with a JetStream based Key-Value store
  latency    Perform latency tests between two NATS servers
  micro      Micro Services discovery and management
  object     Interacts with a JetStream Object Store
  publish    Generic data publish utility
  request    Generic request-reply request utility
  reply      Generic service reply utility
  rtt        Compute round-trip time to NATS server
  schema     Schema tools
  server     Server information
  stream     JetStream Stream management
  subscribe  Generic subscription client
```

To learn about publishing use

```shell
nats publish 

usage: nats publish [<flags>] <subject> [<body>]

Generic data publish utility

Body and Header values of the messages may use Go templates to create unique
messages.

  nats pub test --count 10 "Message {{Count}} @ {{Time}}"

Multiple messages with random strings between 10 and 100 long:

  nats pub test --count 10 "Message {{Count}}: {{ Random 10 100 }}"

Available template functions are:

  Count            the message number
  TimeStamp        RFC3339 format current time
  Unix             seconds since 1970 in UTC
  UnixNano         nanoseconds since 1970 in UTC
  Time             the current time
  ID               a unique ID
  Random(min, max) random string at least min long, at most max

Args:
  <subject>  Subject to subscribe to
  [<body>]   Message body
```
