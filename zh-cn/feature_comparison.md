## NATS Feature Comparison
This feature comparison is a summary of a few of the major components in several of the popular messaging technologies of today. This is by no means an exhaustive list and each technology should be investigated thoroughly to decide which will work best for your implementation.

This comparison features NATS, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Apache Pulsar, and gRPC.

            The NATS network element (server) is a small static binary that can be deployed anywhere from large instances in the cloud to resource constrained devices like a Raspberry PI.
NATS supports the Adaptive Edge architecture which allows for large, flexible deployments.  Single servers, leaf nodes, clusters, and superclusters (cluster of clusters) can be combined in any fashion for an extremely flexible deployment amenable to cloud, on-premise, edge and IoT.  Clients are unaware of topology and can connect to any NATS server in a deployment.
