# Do's and Dont's
* Avoid linking to external information in the step-by-step guide. 
* Explain or refer to a concept front up.
* In the step-by-step section, explain the parameters and options used, nothing else.
* Provide every single command and configuration.
* Do not introduce a new tool in the step-by-step guide
* Concrete parameters - there should be no need to infer anything
* Use concrete names for entities - e.g. from payment processing or retail order management
