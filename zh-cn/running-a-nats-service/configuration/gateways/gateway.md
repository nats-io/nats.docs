# 配置

The `gateway` [configuration block](gateway.md#gateway-configuration-block) is similar to a [`cluster`](../clustering/cluster\_config.md) block:

```
gateway {
    name: "A"
    listen: "localhost:7222"
    authorization {
        user: gwu
        password: gwp
    }

    gateways: [
        {name: "A", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7222"},
        {name: "B", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7333"},
        {name: "C", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7444"},
    ]
}
```

One difference is that instead of `routes` you specify `gateways`. As expected _self-gateway_ connections are ignored, so you can share gateway configurations with minimal fuss.

Starting a server:

```shell
nats-server -c A.conf
```

Once all the gateways are up, these clusters of one will forward messages as expected:

```shell
nats sub -s localhost:4333 ">"
```

On a different session...

```shell
nats pub -s localhost:4444 foo bar
```

The subscriber should print

```
[#1] Received on [foo] : 'bar'
```

| `reject_unknown_cluster` | If `true`, gateway will reject connections from cluster that are not configured in `gateways`. It does so by checking if the cluster name, provided by the incomming connection, exists as named gateway. This effectively disables gossiping of new cluster. It does not restrict a configured gateway, thus cluster, from dynamically growing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |

| `authorization`          | [Authorization](../securing\_nats/auth\_intro/#authorization-map) map for gateways. When a single `username`/`password` is used, it defines the authentication mechanism this server expects, and how this server will authenticate itself when establishing a connection to a _discovered_ gateway. This will not be used for gateways explicitly listed in [`gateways`](gateway.md#gateway-entry) and therefore have to be provided as part of the URL. With this authentication mode, either use the same credentials throughout the system or list every gateway explicitly on every server. If the `tls` configuration map specifies `verify_and_map` only provide the expected `username`. Here different certificates can be used, but they do have to map to the same `username`. The authorization map also allows for `timeout` which is honored but `users` and `token` configuration are not supported and will prevent the server from starting. The `permissions` block is ignored. |         |

### `Gateway` Entry

The `gateways` configuration block is a list of gateway entries with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | Gateway name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `url`    | Hostport `<host>:<port>` describing where the remote gateway can be reached. If multiple IPs are returned, one is randomly selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `urls`   | A list of `url` strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `tls`    | A [`tls` configuration map](../securing\_nats/tls.md) for creating a secure gateway connection. If the top-level `gateway{}` tls block contains certificates that have both client and server purposes, it is possible to omit this one and the server will use the certificates from the `gateway{tls{}}` section. See additional advice below in TLS Entry. |

By using `urls` and an array, you can specify a list of endpoints that form part of a cluster as below. A NATS Server will pick one of those addresses randomly and only establish a single outbound gateway connection to one of the members from another cluster:

```
gateway {
    name: "DC-A"
    listen: "localhost:7222"

    gateways: [
        {name: "DC-A", urls: ["nats://localhost:7222", "nats://localhost:7223", "nats://localhost:7224"]},
        {name: "DC-B", urls: ["nats://localhost:7332", "nats://localhost:7333", "nats://localhost:7334"]},
        {name: "DC-C", urls: ["nats://localhost:7442", "nats://localhost:7333", "nats://localhost:7335"]}
    ]
}
```

### TLS Entry

In addition to the normal TLS configuration advice, bear in mind that TLS keys and certificates for multiple clusters, or servers in different locations, rarely rotate at the exact same time and that Certificate Authorities do roll between multiple Intermediate certificates.

If using a certificate bundle which accompanied the issuance of a certificate then the CA in that bundle will typically be for just that certificate. Using _only_ that CA as the CA for gateway authentication is ill-advised. You should ensure that you allow for rolling between Certificate Authorities, even if only between multiple CAs from the same organization entity, and use a separate certificate bundle for _verification_ of peers. This way when DC-B rolls before DC-A, it will not be cut off from your supercluster.

### Gateway behind Load Balancer

When running in a private network ( such as VPC in the cloud ), you'd probably want to setup a Load Balancer to expose the gateway port. In this case, it's important to set the `advertise` value of each NATS server to the Load Balancer hostname and port serving them. Otherwise, they will advertise their own private IP and port, and can generate failures and downtime if any reconnection is required.
