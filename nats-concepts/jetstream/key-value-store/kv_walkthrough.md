# Key/Value Store Walkthrough

The Key/Value Store is a JetStream feature, so we need to verify it is enabled by

```shell
nats account info
```
which may return

```
JetStream Account Information:

   JetStream is not supported in this account
```

In this case, you should enable JetStream.

## Prerequisite: enabling JetStream

If you are running a local `nats-server` stop it and restart it with JetStream enabled using `nats-server -js` (if that's not already done)

You can then check that JetStream is enabled by using

```shell
nats account info
```

```

## Creating a KV bucket

A 'KV bucket' is like a stream; you need to create it before using it, as in `nats kv add <KV Bucket Name>`:

```shell
nats kv add my-kv
```

```
my_kv Key-Value Store Status

         Bucket Name: my-kv
         History Kept: 1
        Values Stored: 0
           Compressed: false
   Backing Store Kind: JetStream
          Bucket Size: 0 B
  Maximum Bucket Size: unlimited
   Maximum Value Size: unlimited
          Maximum Age: unlimited
     JetStream Stream: KV_my-kv
              Storage: File
```

## Storing a value

Now that we have a bucket, we can assign, or 'put', a value to a specific key:

```shell
nats kv put my-kv Key1 Value1
```

which should return the key's value `Value1`

## Getting a value

We can fetch, or 'get', the value for a key "Key1":

```shell
nats kv get my-kv Key1
```

```
my-kv > Key1 created @ 12 Oct 21 20:08 UTC

Value1
```

## Deleting a value

You can always delete a key and its value by using 
```shell
nats kv del my-kv Key1
```

It is harmless to delete a non-existent key (check this!!).

## Atomic operations

K/V Stores can also be used in concurrent design patterns, such as semaphores, by using atomic 'create' and 'update' operations.

E.g. a client wanting exclusive use of a file can lock it by creating a key, whose value is the file name, with `create` and deleting this key after completing use of that file. A client can increase the reslience against failure by using a timeout for the `bucket` containing this key. The client can use `update` with a revision number to keep the `bucket` alive.

Updates can also be used for more fine-grained concurrency control, sometimes known as `optimistic locking`, where multiple clients can try a task, but only one can successfully complete it.

### Create (aka exclusive locking)
Create a lock/semaphore with the `create` operation.
```shell 
nats kv create my-kv Semaphore1 Value1
```
Only one `create` can succeed. First come, first serve. All concurrent attempts will result in an error until the key is deleted
```shell 
nats kv create my-kv Semaphore1 Value1
nats: error: nats: wrong last sequence: 1: key exists
```

### Update with CAS (aka optimistic locking)
We can also atomically `update`, sometimes known as a CAS (compare and swap) operation, a key with an additional parameter `revision`

```shell 
nats kv update my-kv Semaphore1 Value2 0
```

A second attempt with the same revision 13, will fail

```shell 
nats kv update my-kv Semaphore1 Value2 0
nats: error: nats: wrong last sequence: 1
```

You can view the history and revision value of a key using the `history` command

```shell
nats kv history my-kv Semaphore1
```

## Watching a K/V Store

An unusual functionality of a K/V Store is being able to 'watch' a bucket, or a specific key in that bucket, and receive real-time updates to changes in the store.

For the example above, run `nats kv watch my-kv`. This will start a watcher on the bucket we have just created earlier. By default, the KV bucket has a history size of one, and so it only remembers the last change. In our case, the watcher should see a delete of the value associated with the key "Key1":

```shell
nats kv watch my-kv
```

```
[2021-10-12 13:15:03] DEL my-kv > Key1
```

If we now concurrently change the value of 'my-kv' by

```shell
nats kv put my-kv Key1 Value2
```

The watcher will see that change:

```shell
[2021-10-12 13:25:14] PUT my-kv > Key1: Value2
```

## Cleaning up

When you are finished using a bucket, you can delete the bucket, and its resources, by using the `rm` operator:

```shell
nats kv rm my-kv
```
