# Consumers

Consumers can be conceived as 'views' into a stream, with their own 'cursor'. Consumers iterate or consume over all or a subset of the messages stored in the stream, according to their 'subject filter' and 'replay policy', and can be used by one or multiple client applications. It's ok to define thousands of these pointing at the same Stream.

Consumers can either be `push` based where JetStream will deliver the messages as fast as possible \(while adhering to the rate limit policy\) to a subject of your choice or `pull` to have control by asking the server for messages. The choice of what kind of consumer to use depends on the use-case but typically in the case of a client application that needs to get their own individual replay of messages from a stream you would use an 'ordered push consumer', while in the case of scaling horizontally the processing of messages from a stream you would use a 'pull consumer'.

The rate of message delivery in both cases is subject to `ReplayPolicy`. A `ReplayInstant` Consumer will receive all messages as fast as possible while a `ReplayOriginal` Consumer will receive messages at the rate they were received, which is great for replaying production traffic in staging.

In the orders example above we have 3 Consumers. The first two select a subset of the messages from the Stream by specifying a specific subject like `ORDERS.processed`. The Stream consumes `ORDERS.*` and this allows you to receive just what you need. The final Consumer receives all messages in a `push` fashion.

Consumers track their progress, they know what messages were delivered, acknowledged, etc., and will redeliver messages they sent that were not acknowledged. When first created, the Consumer has to know what message to send as the first one. You can configure either a specific message in the set \(`StreamSeq`\), specific time \(`StartTime`\), all \(`DeliverAll`\) or last \(`DeliverLast`\). This is the starting point and from there, they all behave the same - delivering all of the following messages with optional Acknowledgement.

Acknowledgements default to `AckExplicit` - the only supported mode for pull-based Consumers - meaning every message requires a distinct acknowledgement. But for push-based Consumers, you can set `AckNone` that does not require any acknowledgement, or `AckAll` which quite interestingly allows you to acknowledge a specific message, like message `100`, which will also acknowledge messages `1` through `99`. The `AckAll` mode can be a great performance boost.

Some messages may cause your applications to crash and cause a never ending loop forever poisoning your system. The `MaxDeliver` setting allow you to set an upper bound to how many times a message may be delivered.

To assist with creating monitoring applications, one can set a `SampleFrequency` which is a percentage of messages for which the system should sample and create events. These events will include delivery counts and ack waits.

### Consumer names
Consumer names should not contain any of the following characters: ` ` (space), `.`, `*`, `>`, or a path separator (forward or backwards slash) or any non-printable characters.

# Consumer configuration
When defining Consumers the items below make up the entire configuration of the Consumer:

## AckPolicy

How messages should be acknowledged. If an ack is required but is not received within the AckWait window, the message will be redelivered.

> IMPORTANT
>
> The server may consider an ack arriving out of the window. If a first process fails to ack within the window it's entirely possible, for instance in queue situation, that the message has been redelivered to another consumer. Since this will technically restart the window, the ack from the first consumer will be considered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The consumer's acknowledgement policy **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### AckExplicit

This is the default policy. It means that each individual message must be acknowledged. It is the only allowed option for pull consumers.

### AckNone

You do not have to ack any messages, the server will assume ack on delivery.

### AckAll

If you receive a series of messages, you only have to ack the last one you received. All the previous messages received are automatically acknowledged.

## AckWait

Ack Wait is the time in nanoseconds that the server will wait for an ack for any individual message _once it has been delivered to a consumer_. If an ack is not received in time, the message will be redelivered.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's ack wait value _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## DeliverPolicy / OptStartSeq / OptStartTime

When a consumer is first created, it can specify where in the stream it wants to start receiving messages. This is the `DeliverPolicy` and it's options are as follows:

{% hint style="warning" %}
The consumer's deliver policy **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### DeliverAll

All is the default policy. The consumer will start receiving from the earliest available message.

### DeliverLast

When first consuming messages, the consumer will start receiving messages with the last message added to the stream, or the last message in the stream that matches the consumer's filter subject if defined.

### DeliverLastPerSubject

When first consuming messages, start with the latest one for each filtered subject currently in the stream.

### DeliverNew

When first consuming messages, the consumer will only start receiving messages that were created after the consumer was created.

### DeliverByStartSequence

When first consuming messages, start at this particular message in the set. The consumer is required to specify `OptStartSeq`, the sequence number to start on. It will receive the closest available message moving forward in the sequence should the message specified have been removed based on the stream limit policy.

### DeliverByStartTime

When first consuming messages, start with messages on or after this time. The consumer is required to specify `OptStartTime`, the time in the stream to start at. It will receive the closest available message on or after that time.

## Durable \(Name\)

The name of the Consumer, which the server will track, allowing resuming consumption where left off. By default, a consumer is ephemeral. To make the consumer durable, set the name.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The consumer's name **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## Description

A description of the Consumer. This is particularly useful for ephemeral consumers to indicate their purpose since the durable name cannot be provided.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's description _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## FilterSubject

When consuming from a stream with a wildcard subject, this allows you to select a subset of the full wildcard subject to receive messages from.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's filter subject _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## InactiveThreshold

Duration that instructs the server to cleanup consumers that are inactive for that long.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's inactive threshold _can_ be changed after the initial creation of the consumer.
**Note:** Prior to NATS server 2.9, this only applied to ephemeral consumers.
{% endhint %}

## MaxAckPending

MaxAckPending implements a simple form of _one-to-many_ flow control. It sets the maximum number of messages without an acknowledgement that can be outstanding, once this limit is reached message delivery will be suspended. It cannot be used with AckNone ack policy. This maximum number of pending acks applies for _all_ of the consumer's subscriber processes. A value of -1 means there can be any number of pending acks (i.e. no flow control).

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's max number of acks pending _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### Note about push and pull consumers:

The MaxAckPending's one-to-many flow control functionality applies for both push and pull consumers. For push consumers MaxAckPending is the _only_ form of flow control. However, for pull consumers because the delivery of the messages to the client application is demand-driven (hence the 'pull') rather than server initiated (hence the 'push') there is an implicit one-to-one flow control with the subscribers (the maximum batch size of the Fetch calls). Therefore you should remember to set it to an appropriately high value (e.g. the default value of 20000), as it can otherwise place a limit on the horizontal scalability of the processing of the stream in high throughput situations.

## MaxDeliver

The maximum number of times a specific message delivery will be attempted. Applies to any message that is re-sent due to ack policy (i.e. due to a negative ack, or no ack being sent by consumer).

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's max number of delivery attempts _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## ReplayPolicy

The replay policy applies when the DeliverPolicy is `DeliverAll`, `DeliverByStartSequence` or `DeliverByStartTime` since those deliver policies begin reading the stream at a position other than the end. If the policy is `ReplayOriginal`, the messages in the stream will be pushed to the client at the same rate that they were originally received, simulating the original timing of messages. If the policy is `ReplayInstant` \(the default\), the messages will be pushed to the client as fast as possible while adhering to the Ack Policy, Max Ack Pending and the client's ability to consume those messages.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The replay policy **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## Replicas

Sets the number of replicas for the consumer's state. By default, consumers inherit the number of replicas from the stream (expressed as the value being `0`).

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's number of replicas _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## MemoryStorage

If set, MemoryStorage forces the consumer state to be kept in memory rather than inherit the setting from the stream.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's number of replicas _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## SampleFrequency

Sets the percentage of acknowledgements that should be sampled for observability, 0-100 This value is a string and for example allows both `30` and `30%` as valid values.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consumer's sample frequency _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## Pull consumer specific attributes
These attributes apply only to pull consumers.

### MaxWaiting

The maximum number of waiting pull requests.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The consumer's maximum number of waiting pull requests **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

## Push consumer specific attributes
These attributes apply only to push consumers.

### DeliverSubject

The subject to deliver observed messages, specifying a delivery subject makes the consumer a 'push consumer' as 'pull consumers' do not need a static delivery subject. If you want to distribute the messages between the subscribers to the consumer then you also need to specify a queue group name.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The push consumer's deliver subject **_can not_** be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### DeliverGroup

The queue group name which, if specified, is then used to distribute the messages between the subscribers to the consumer.

{% hint style="info" %}
The push consumer's queue group name _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### FlowControl

This flow control setting is to enable or not another form of flow control in parallel to MaxAckPending. But unlike MaxAckPending it is a _one-to-one_ flow control that operates independently for each individual subscriber to the consumer. It uses a sliding-window flow-control protocol whose attributes (e.g. size of the window) are _not_ user adjustable.

{% hint style="info" %}
The push consumer's flow control setting _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### IdleHeartbeat

If the idle heartbeat period is set, the server will regularly send a status message to the client (i.e. when the period has elapsed) while there are no new messages to send. This lets the client know that the JetStream service is still up and running, even when there is no activity on the stream. The message status header will have a code of 100. Unlike FlowControl, it will have no reply to address. It may have a description like "Idle Heartbeat".

{% hint style="info" %}
The push consumer's idle heartbeat period _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### RateLimit

Used to throttle the delivery of messages to the consumer, in bits per second.

{% hint style="info" %}
The push rate limit _can_ be adjusted after the initial creation of the consumer
{% endhint %}

### HeadersOnly

Delivers only the headers of messages in the stream and not the bodies. Additionally adds `Nats-Msg-Size` header to indicate the size of the removed payload.

{% hint style="info" %}
This field _can_ be updated after the initial creation of the consumer.
{% endhint %}
