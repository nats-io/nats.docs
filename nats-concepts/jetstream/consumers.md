# Consumers

A consumer is a stateful **view** of a stream. It acts as an interface for clients to _consume_ a subset of messages stored in a stream and will keep
track of which messages were delivered and acknowledged by clients. 

Unlike [Core NATS](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/core-nats), which provides an at most once delivery guarantee, a consumer in JetStream can provide an at least **once delivery** guarantee.

While **Streams** are responsible for storing the published messages, the consumer is responsible for tracking the delivery and acknowledgments.
This tracking ensures that if a message is not acknowledged (un-acked or 'nacked'), the consumer will automatically attempt to re-deliver it. JetStream consumers support various acknowledgment types and policies. If a message is not
acknowledged within a user-specified number of delivery attempts, an advisory notification is emitted.

 ## Dispatch type - Pull / Push
Consumers can be **push**-based where messages will be delivered to a specified subject or **pull**-based which allows clients to request batches of messages on
demand. The choice of what kind of consumer to use depends on the use-case.

If there is a need to process messages in an application controlled manner and easily scale horizontally, you would use a 'pull consumer'. A simple
client application that wants a replay of messages from a stream sequentially you would use an 'ordered push consumer'. An application that wants to
benefit from load balancing or acknowledge messages individually will use a regular push consumer.

{% hint style="info" %}We recommend pull consumers for new projects. In particular when scalability, detailed flow control or error handling are a
concern. {% endhint %}

### Ordered Consumers
Ordered consumers are the convenient default type of push & pull consumers designed for applications that want to efficiently consume a
stream for data inspection or analysis.
* Always ephemeral
* No acknowledgements (if gap is detected, consumer is recreated)
* Automatic flow control/pull processing
* Single-threaded dispatching
* No load balancing


## Persistence - Durable / Ephemeral
In addition to the choice of being push or pull, a consumer can also be **ephemeral** or **durable**. A consumer
is considered _durable_ when an explicit name is set on the `Durable` field when creating the consumer, or when `InactiveThreshold` is set.

Durables and ephemeral have the same message delivery semantics but an ephemeral consumer will not have persisted state or fault tolerance (server
memory only) and will be automatically _cleaned up_ (deleted) after a period of inactivity, when no subscriptions are bound to the consumer.

By default, consumers will have the same replication factor as the stream they consume, and will remain even when there are periods of inactivity (unless
`InactiveThreshold` is set explicitly). Consumers can recover from server and client failure.

## Configuration

Below are the set of consumer configuration options that can be defined. The `Version` column indicates the version of nats-server in which the option
was introduced. The `Editable` column indicates the option can be edited after the consumer is created.

### General

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Version | Editable |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Durable           | If set, clients can have subscriptions bind to the consumer and _resume_ until the consumer is explicitly deleted. A durable name cannot contain whitespace, `.`, `*`, `>`, path separators (forward or backward slash), or non-printable characters.                                                                                          | 2.2.0   | No       |
| [FilterSubject](#filtersubjects)  | A subject that overlaps with the subjects bound to the stream to filter delivery to subscribers. Note: This cannot be used with the `FilterSubjects` field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| [AckPolicy](#ackpolicy) | The requirement of client acknowledgments, either `AckExplicit`, `AckNone`, or `AckAll`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2.2.0   | No       |
| AckWait           | The duration that the server will wait for an acknowledgment for any individual message _once it has been delivered to a consumer_. If an acknowledgment is not received in time, the message will be redelivered. This setting is only effective when `BackOff` is **not configured**.  | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| [DeliverPolicy](#deliverpolicy) | The point in the stream from which to receive messages: `DeliverAll`, `DeliverLast`, `DeliverNew`, `DeliverByStartSequence`, `DeliverByStartTime`, or `DeliverLastPerSubject`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2.2.0   | No       |
| OptStartSeq       | Used with the `DeliverByStartSequence` deliver policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2.2.0   | No       |
| OptStartTime      | Used with the `DeliverByStartTime` deliver policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2.2.0   | No       |
| Description       | A description of the consumer. This can be particularly useful for ephemeral consumers to indicate their purpose since a durable name cannot be provided.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2.3.3   | Yes      |
| InactiveThreshold | Duration that instructs the server to clean up consumers inactive for that long. Prior to 2.9, this only applied to ephemeral consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| [MaxAckPending](#maxackpending) | Defines the maximum number of messages, without acknowledgment, that can be outstanding. Once this limit is reached, message delivery will be suspended. This limit applies across _all_ of the consumer's bound subscriptions. A value of -1 means there can be any number of pending acknowledgments (i.e., no flow control). The default is 1000.                          | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| MaxDeliver        | The maximum number of times a specific message delivery will be attempted. Applies to any message that is re-sent due to acknowledgment policy (i.e., due to a negative acknowledgment or no acknowledgment sent by the client). The default is -1 (redeliver until acknowledged). Messages that have reached the maximum delivery count will stay in the stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| Backoff           | A sequence of delays controlling the re-delivery of messages on acknowledgment timeout (but not on `nak`). The sequence length must be less than or equal to `MaxDeliver`. If backoff is not set, a timeout will result in immediate re-delivery. E.g., `MaxDeliver=5` `backoff=[5s, 30s, 300s, 3600s, 84000s]` will re-deliver a message 5 times over one day. When `MaxDeliver` is larger than the backoff list, the last delay in the list will apply for the remaining deliveries. Note that backoff is NOT applied to `nak`ed messages. A `nak` will result in immediate re-delivery unless `nakWithDelay` is used to set the re-delivery delay explicitly. When `BackOff` is set, it **overrides `AckWait` entirely**. The first value in the BackOff determines the `AckWait` value. | 2.7.1   | Yes      |
| ReplayPolicy      | If the policy is `ReplayOriginal`, the messages in the stream will be pushed to the client at the same rate they were originally received, simulating the original timing. If the policy is `ReplayInstant` (default), the messages will be pushed to the client as fast as possible while adhering to the acknowledgment policy, Max Ack Pending, and the client's ability to consume those messages. | 2.2.0   | No       |
| Replicas          | Sets the number of replicas for the consumer's state. By default, when the value is set to zero, consumers inherit the number of replicas from the stream.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2.8.3   | Yes      |
| MemoryStorage     | If set, forces the consumer state to be kept in memory rather than inherit the storage type of the stream (default is file storage). This reduces I/O from acknowledgments, useful for ephemeral consumers.                                                                                                                                   | 2.8.3   | No       |
| SampleFrequency   | Sets the percentage of acknowledgments that should be sampled for observability, 0-100. This value is a string and allows both `30` and `30%` as valid values.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| Metadata          | A set of application-defined key-value pairs for associating metadata with the consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2.10.0  | Yes      |
| [FilterSubjects](consumers.md#filtersubjects) | A set of subjects that overlap with the subjects bound to the stream to filter delivery to subscribers. Note: This cannot be used with the `FilterSubject` field.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2.10.0  | Yes      |

#### AckPolicy

The policy choices include:

* `AckExplicit`: The default policy. Each individual message must be acknowledged. Recommended for most reliability and functionality.
* `AckNone`: No acknowledgment needed; the server assumes acknowledgment on delivery.
* `AckAll`: Acknowledge only the last message received in a series; all previous messages are automatically acknowledged. Will acknowledge all pending
  messages for all subscribers for Pull Consumer.

If an acknowledgment is required but not received within the `AckWait` window, the message will be redelivered.

> **Warning**: The server may consider an acknowledgment arriving out of the window. For instance, in a queue situation, if a first process fails to acknowledge within the window and the message has been redelivered to another consumer, the acknowledgment from the first consumer will be considered.

#### DeliverPolicy

The policy choices include:

* `DeliverAll`: Default policy. Start receiving from the earliest available message in the stream.
* `DeliverLast`: Start with the last message added to the stream, or the last message matching the consumer's filter subject if defined.
* `DeliverLastPerSubject`: Start with the latest message for each filtered subject currently in the stream.
* `DeliverNew`: Start receiving messages created after the consumer was created.
* `DeliverByStartSequence`: Start at the first message with the specified sequence number. The consumer must specify `OptStartSeq` defining the sequence number.
* `DeliverByStartTime`: Start with messages on or after the specified time. The consumer must specify `OptStartTime` defining the start time.

#### MaxAckPending

The `MaxAckPending` capability provides flow control and applies to both push and pull consumers. For push consumers, `MaxAckPending` is the only form of flow control. For pull consumers, client-driven message delivery creates implicit one-to-one flow control with subscribers.

For high throughput, set `MaxAckPending` to a high value. For applications with high latency due to external services, use a lower value and adjust `AckWait` to avoid re-deliveries.

#### FilterSubjects

A filter subject provides server-side filtering of messages before delivery to clients.

For example, a stream `factory-events` with subject `factory-events.*.*` can have a consumer `factory-A` with a filter `factory-events.A.*` to deliver only events for factory `A`.

A consumer can have a singular `FilterSubject` or plural `FilterSubjects`. Multiple filters can be applied, such as `[factory-events.A.*, factory-events.B.*]` or specific event types `[factory-events.*.item_produced, factory-events.*.item_packaged]`.

> **Warning**: For granular consumer permissions, a single filter uses `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.{stream}.{consumer}.{filter}` to restrict users to specific filters. Multiple filters use the general `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.{stream}.{consumer}`, which does not include the `{filter}` token. Use a different strategy for granular permissions.

### Pull-specific
These options apply only to pull consumers. For configuration examples, see [NATS by Example](https://natsbyexample.com/examples/jetstream/pull-consumer/go).

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Version | Editable |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| MaxWaiting         | The maximum number of waiting pull requests.                                                                                                                         | 2.2.0   | No       |
| MaxRequestExpires  | The maximum duration a single pull request will wait for messages to be available to pull.                                                                           | 2.7.0   | Yes      |
| MaxRequestBatch    | The maximum batch size a single pull request can make. When set with `MaxRequestMaxBytes`, the batch size will be constrained by whichever limit is hit first.       | 2.7.0   | Yes      |
| MaxRequestMaxBytes | The maximum total bytes that can be requested in a given batch. When set with `MaxRequestBatch`, the batch size will be constrained by whichever limit is hit first. | 2.8.3   | Yes      |

### Push-specific

These options apply only to push consumers. For configuration examples, see [NATS by Example](https://natsbyexample.com/examples/jetstream/push-consumer/go).

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Version | Editable |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| DeliverSubject | The subject to deliver messages to. Setting this field decides whether the consumer is push or pull-based. With a deliver subject, the server will _push_ messages to clients subscribed to this subject.                                                                                                                                                                | 2.2.0   | No       |
| DeliverGroup   | The queue group name used to distribute messages among subscribers. Analogous to a [queue group](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/core-nats/queue) in core NATS.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| FlowControl    | Enables per-subscription flow control using a sliding-window protocol. This protocol relies on the server and client exchanging messages to regulate when and how many messages are pushed to the client. This one-to-one flow control mechanism works in tandem with the one-to-many flow control imposed by `MaxAckPending` across all subscriptions bound to a consumer. | 2.2.0   | Yes      |
| IdleHeartbeat  | If set, the server will regularly send a status message to the client during inactivity, indicating that the JetStream service is up and running.
