types:
  cluster:
    type: object
    disabled: true
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Name of the cluster.

      host:
        type: host
        description: |-
          Host for cluster route connections.

      port:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          Port for cluster route connections.
        default: 6222

      listen:
        type: listen

      tls:
        type: tls
        description: |-
          TLS configuration for securing cluster connections.
          `verify` is always enabled and `cert_file` is used for
          both client and server for mutual TLS.

      advertise:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Advertised cluster `<host>:<port>`. Useful for cluster setups since
          behind NAT. When using TLS this is important to set to control the
          hostname that clients will use when discovering the route so TLS
          hostname verification does not fail.
        aliases:
          - cluster_advertise

      no_advertise:
        type: boolean
        description: |-
          If true, the server will not send or gossip its client URLs to other servers in the cluster, nor
          will it tell its clients about other servers' client URLs.

      routes:
        type: array(string)
        description: |-
          A list of server URLs to cluster with. Self-routes are ignored. Should authentication via token or username/password
          be required, specify them as part of the URL.
        examples:
          - label: Simple Route URLs
            value: |
              routes: [
                nats-route://localhost:6222,
                nats-route://localhost:6223,
                nats-route://localhost:6224,
              ]

      connect_retries:
        type: integer
        default: 0
        description: |-
          After how many failed connect attempts to give up establishing a connection to a *discovered* route. Default is 0, do not retry.
          When enabled, attempts will be made once a second. This, does not apply to explicitly configured routes.

      authorization:
        type: authorization
        description: |-
          Authorization map for configuring cluster routes. When a single username/password is used, it defines the authentication mechanism
          this server expects, and how this server will authenticate itself when establishing a connection to a discovered route. This will
          not be used for routes explicitly listed in routes and therefore have to be provided as part of the URL. With this authentication
          mode, either use the same credentials throughout the system or list every route explicitly on every server.

          If the `tls` configuration map specifies `verify_and_map` only, provide the expected username. Here different certificates can be
          used, but they have to map to the same `username`. The authorization map also allows for timeout which is honored but users and
          token configuration are not supported and will prevent the server from starting. The `permissions` block is ignored.
