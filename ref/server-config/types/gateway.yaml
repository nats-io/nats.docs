types:
  gateways:
    type: object
    disabled: true
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Name of this cluster. All gateway connections belonging to the
          same cluster must specify the same name.

      reject_unknown_cluster:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          If true, gateway will reject connections from cluster that are
          not configured in gateways. It does so by checking if the cluster
          name, provided by the incomming connection, exists as named gateway.
          This effectively disables gossiping of new cluster. It does not
          restrict a configured gateway, thus cluster, from dynamically growing.

      host:
        type: host
        default: 0.0.0.0
        description: |-
          Interface where the gateway will listen for incoming gateway
          connections.

      port:
        type: integer
        default: 7222
        description: |-
          Port where the gateway will listen for incoming gateway connections.

      listen:
        type: listen
        description: |-
          `<host>:<port>` format. Alternative to `host`/`port`.

      tls:
        type: tls
        description: |-
          A `tls` configuration map for securing gateway connections. `verify`
          is always enabled. Unless otherwise, `cert_file` will be the default
          client certificate.

      advertise:
        type: string
        description: |-
          `<host>:<port>` to advertise how this server can be contacted by
          other gateway members. This is useful in setups with NAT.

      connect_retries:
        type: integer
        default: 0
        description: |-
          After how many failed connect attempts to give up establishing
          a connection to a discovered gateway. Default is 0, do not retry.
          When enabled, attempts will be made once a second. This, does not
          apply to explicitly configured gateways.

      authorization:
        type: authorization
        description: |-
          Authorization map for gateways. When a single username/password is
          used, it defines the authentication mechanism this server expects,
          and how this server will authenticate itself when establishing
          a connection to a discovered gateway. This will not be used for
          gateways explicitly listed in gateways and therefore have to be
          provided as part of the URL. With this authentication mode, either
          use the same credentials throughout the system or list every gateway
          explicitly on every server. If the tls configuration map specifies
          verify_and_map only provide the expected username. Here different
          certificates can be used, but they do have to map to the same username.
          The authorization map also allows for timeout which is honored but
          users and token configuration are not supported and will prevent the
          server from starting. The permissions block is ignored.

      gateways:
        type: array(gateway)
        description: |-
          List of gateway entries.


  gateway:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Name of the gateway being connected to.
      url:
        type: string
        description: |-
          A single URL to connect to.

      urls:
        type: array(string)
        description: |-
          A list of URLs to connect to (multiple servers in a cluster).

      tls:
        type: tls
        description: |-
          A TLS configuration map for creating a secure gateway connection.
          If the top-level gateway{} tls block contains certificates that have
          both client and server purposes, it is possible to omit this one
          and the server will use the certificates from the gateway{tls{}}
          section.
