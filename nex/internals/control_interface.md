# Nex Control Interface
The Nex control interface is an API through which you can remotely control Nex nodes. This API provides the ability to ping/discover all nodes, interrogate node and workload state, as well as deploy and undeploy workloads.

This API is currently undergoing rapid changes and so the code is the best resource at the moment. Once the API stabilizes, we will have more concrete documentation in place.
