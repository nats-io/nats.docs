# Request-Reply

The pattern of sending a message and receiving a response is encapsulated in most client libraries into a request method. Under the covers this method will publish a message with a unique reply-to subject and wait for the response before returning.

In the older versions of some libraries a completely new reply-to subject is created each time. In newer versions, a subject hierarchy is used so that a single subscriber in the client library listens for a wildcard, and requests are sent with a unique child subject of a single subject.

The primary difference between the request method and publishing with a reply-to is that the library is only going to accept one response, and in most libraries the request will be treated as a synchronous action. The library may even provide a way to set the timeout.

For example, updating the previous publish example we may request `time` with a one second timeout:

!INCLUDE "../../_examples/request_reply.html"

You can think of request-reply in the library as a subscribe, get one message, unsubscribe pattern. In Go this might look something like:

```go
sub, err := nc.SubscribeSync(replyTo)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
nc.Flush()

// Send the request
nc.PublishRequest(subject, replyTo, []byte(input))

// Wait for a single response
for {
    msg, err := sub.NextMsg(1 * time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    response = string(msg.Data)
    break
}
sub.Unsubscribe()
```

## Scatter-Gather

You can expand the request-reply pattern into something often called scatter-gather. To receive multiple messages, with a timeout, you could do something like the following, where the loop getting messages is using time as the limitation, not the receipt of a single message:

```go
sub, err := nc.SubscribeSync(replyTo)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
nc.Flush()

// Send the request
nc.PublishRequest(subject, replyTo, []byte(input))

// Wait for a single response
max := 100 * time.Millisecond
start := time.Now()
for time.Now().Sub(start) < max {
    msg, err := sub.NextMsg(1 * time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        break
    }

    responses = append(responses, string(msg.Data))
}
sub.Unsubscribe()
```

Or, you can loop on a counter and a timeout to try to get _at least N_ responses:

```go
sub, err := nc.SubscribeSync(replyTo)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
nc.Flush()

// Send the request
nc.PublishRequest(subject, replyTo, []byte(input))

// Wait for a single response
max := 500 * time.Millisecond
start := time.Now()
for time.Now().Sub(start) < max {
    msg, err := sub.NextMsg(1 * time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        break
    }

    responses = append(responses, string(msg.Data))

    if len(responses) >= minResponses {
        break
    }
}
sub.Unsubscribe()
```
